# Book Exercises for The C Programming Language

Decided to go through the book exercises for the well-known thriller 'The C programming Language' by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie (Second Edition - ANSI C). Wish me luck. 
Update: I believe that is every exercise done now! Let me know if any are missing or if there are improvements that could be made to the solutions. :)
